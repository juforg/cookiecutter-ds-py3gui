- A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._
- A template for command-line utility **cookiecutters** to create a Python 3 package with a PySimpleGUI.
- `cookiecutter` is a command-line utility that creates projects from 
cookiecutters (project templates). See
[cookiecutter.readthedocs.io](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/index.html).

#### [Project homepage](https://github.com/juforg/cookiecutter-ds-py3gui/)

## Motivation

A project template that promotes good practices for reproducible 
data science (immutablity of raw data, seperation of exploratory code and 
"final" analysis code), while giving options for more or less complex projects

### Features
-----------

* Works on 3.7 (Earlier Python versions untested).
* choice for managing packages and virtualenvs
    - [Pipenv] 
    - pip
    - conda
* Modern CLI with [Typer].
* Batteries included: [Pandas], [numpy], [scipy], [seaborn], and [jupyterlab] already installed.
* Consistent code quality: [black], [isort], [autoflake], and [pylint] already installed.
* [Pytest] for testing.
* Provide a operation research (OR) demo
* Provide a machine learning (ML) demo  sales predict

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 3.7+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

Install the latest Cookiecutter and Pipenv:
``` bash
$ pip install -U pipenv cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/uyfETRhchKNX0FyQiuB2ZX3IY.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/uyfETRhchKNX0FyQiuB2ZX3IY)
```bash
    cookiecutter gh:juforg/cookiecutter-ds-py3gui
```
#### Params Description
- use_gui
    > whether to use gui packages, such as mip,pulp 
- use_ml
    > whether to use machine learning packages, such as lightgbm , wandb
- use_or
    > whether to use operation research (OR)
####
Get inside the project:

    cd <repo_name>
    pipenv shell  # activates virtualenv


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:

This project is meant to adapt (and borrows liberally from) Driven Data's 
[cookicutter-data-science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science#keep-secrets-and-configuration-out-of-version-control) 
structure and philosophy to slightly different needs.
